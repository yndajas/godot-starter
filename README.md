# Godot starter

This is a starting point for making a game with Godot, made for a [QueerTech
Bristol][qtb] workshop

## Where to start

- Check the commit messages to see what's been done so far
- Check some of my Godot projects for inspiration (code, commits, gameplay):
  - [Get the Pumpkin!][gtp] - basic platformer
  - [Gay Ray][gr] - Space Invaders style
  - [It's Closing Time][ict] - get rid of customers against the clock
- Iterate on the game. For instance:
  - Build out the level, placing more tiles
  - Source or make some sounds and have these trigger on jump. [Jsfxr][] is a
    good tool for this
  - Replace the assets with something of your choice. [Kenney.nl][knl] is a good
    resource for this
  - Add additional frames to the run animation to create a sense of movement
  - Add an end zone and trigger a congratulatory message when the player enters
  - Add a clock so players can try to reach the end in record time
  - Add another level and transition to level two when the player
    reaches the end of level one
  - Add a tutorial scene displaying the game's title (your choice), credits,
    and/or controls
  - Add jump buffering and/or coyote time for better feel
- Start something different from scratch!
